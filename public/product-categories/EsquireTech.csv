A comprehensive RAM/VR cooling set is also included to improve the cooling performance of RAM/VR. Featuring a 92 mm PWM fan and a cooling capacity of 120 Watts, the Accelero L2 PLUS ensures components are performing under ideal temperature. The pre-applied MX-4 thermal compound allows enhanced thermal conductivity from the GPU, thus considerably extending its service life. In order to boost the cooling efficiency of RAM and VR, the Accelero L2 PLUS comes with the G-1, an electrically non-conductive thermal glue used to affix RAM and VR heat sinks on the VGA board. Unlike generic thermal tapes, the G-1 offers high thermal conductivity with excellent adhesiveness. Moreover, removing the G-1 is extremely easy without leaving any residues. Operated by a low noise impeller enclosed in a patented fan holder to reduce the buzzing sound when the fan is spinning, the Arctic Accelero L2 PLUS is barely audible even running at full load. To enable minimum noise level at all circumstances, the PWM controller enables the fan to run at the optimal speed according to the load generated by the GPU.</font></p> <div><font face=""Arial""><strong>Compatible with:</strong><br />&nbsp;- ATI: 7770 / 7750 / 6850 / 6790 / 6770 / 6750 / 6670LP / 6570 / 5850 / 5830 / 5770 / 5550 / 5870 / 4850 / 4830 / 4770 / 4730 / 4670 / 4650 / 4550 / 4350LP<br />&nbsp;<br />- NVidia: 640 / 450 / 240 / 440 / 340 / 320 / 240 / 9800GTX+ / 9800GTX / 9800 GT / 9600 GT / 9600 GSO / 9500 GT / 8800 GTS / 8800 GT / 8800GS / 8600GTS / 8600GT</font></div> <p><font face=""Arial""><strong>Features</strong><br />&#8226; Superior cooling performance - 120 Watts<br />&#8226; Ultra quiet 92 mm PWM fan with low noise impeller<br />&#8226; RAM and voltage regulator cooling<br />&#8226; Pre-applied ARCTIC MX-4<br />&#8226; CrossFire and SLI compatible<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Specifications</strong><br />&#8226;&nbsp;Max.

In addition, the Intellinet switch can adjust the level of power output based on the length of the network cable connected to a particular port.

Patented technologies, direct touch heat pipes, precision machining, a fan vibration absorption and a brand new mounting system offers you plenty of overclocking headroom at a minimal noise level. This amazing CPU Cooler from ARCTIC delivers top-notch cooling and airflow to your high-end systems , it delivers a superior cooling performance to keep your system running at optimum levels. It comes with a large 120mm PWM fan that effectively cools down your CPU and dissipates heat, especially during those intense computing sessions. Plus, thanks to its low noise impeller and rubber vibration absorbers, it produces a paltry noise level of only 0.3 Sone for virtually silent operations.<br /> <br /> </font><font face=""Arial""><strong>Features</strong><br /> <strong><em>&#8226;4 Mounting Directions:-</em></strong>The Freezer A30 can be mounted in all 4 directions in order to satisfy different air flow preferences due to various PC case and hard ware configurations. </font></div> <p><font face=""Arial""><strong><em>&#8226;Direct Touch Heat pipe Heatsink:-</em></strong>The Freezer A30 Heatsink consists of 4 double-sided direct touch heat pipes, 8mm in diameter. A patented process (20 2011 000 71.8) allows us to pack the heat pipes without gaps and thus increase the contact surface and achieve better flatness by precision machining - both leading to an improved heat transfer.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial""><em><strong>&#8226;Efficient Heat Dissipation:-</strong></em>As a combined result of the 4 direct touch heat pipes, 48 Aluminium fins, an interchangeable 120 mm PWM Fan (ARCTIC F12 PWM), and the famous ARCTIC MX-4 thermal compound (included), the Freezer A30 offers superior cooling performance with a maximum cooling capacity of 320 Watts and lots of headroom for overclocking.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial""><strong><em>&#8226;Virtually Silent:-</em></strong>Due to the low-noise impeller of the Arctic F12 PWM fan and the rubber vibration absorbers, the Freezer A30 generates a negligible noise level of only 0.3 Sone even at full speed (1,350 RPM). Furthermore, as controlled by PWM signal, this fan runs only at the optimized speed based on actual needs, which in turns minimizes the noise level further.</font></p> <p><font face=""Arial""><strong><em>&#8226;Sturdy Mounting Mechanism:-</em></strong>There is no need to worry about the weight of this muscular, yet gentle cooler. The Arctic Freezer A30 applies a durable steel mounting clip and a back-plate*.

Its rich black surface is timelessly classic, without corners and edges, and is made for every workplace and every gaming niche. Its symmetrical shape with easily accessible, flat side buttons is perfectly ergonomic and is always comfortable while working and playing. The textile braided cable, in typical black-yellow SHARK ZONE design, as well as the matching white illuminated logo and RGB illuminated bottom, show off all the necessary highlights. Thanks to its comfortable, rubber surface the featherweight M52 remains comfortable and keeps a perfect hold even after hours of use.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div id=""pastingspan1""></div> <div id=""pastingspan1""><strong>Demanding Inside</strong></div> <div id=""pastingspan1"">As much as the outside of the M52 shows its gentle side, it is just as demanding on its inside: high quality Omron switches in both the left and right mouse buttons ensure a long operating life cycle of at least 10 million clicks. The Avago ADNS-9800 laser sensor achieves a highly precise 8,200 DPI, which can be individually set for every situation in gradual 100 DPI steps. Four DPI steps are already factory preset and can be accessed quickly via the discreet DPI button on its surface, which will increase the SHARK ZONE logo brightness with each adjusted step. Like all the other seven buttons on the M52, the DPI selector can be assigned up to five individual configurations through the provided software, which contains numerous Windows and multimedia commands, X-shot function as well as macros.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div id=""pastingspan1""></div> <div id=""pastingspan1""><strong>And Always Easy to Use</strong></div> <div id=""pastingspan1"">A current game profile, including all software settings, can be saved directly to the onboard memory of the M52; there is no limit to the number of additional profiles that can be created and saved on the PC and then loaded onto the mouse. The software is designed so that all functions are easily customized with a few clicks as possible. All changes are then immediately transferred to the M52 in real time. The four preset DPI steps as well as the RGB illumination for the color and effects on the bottom can be easily adjusted. The mouse sensitivity, mouse acceleration and polling rage can also be easily adjusted, as well.</div> </div>";Computers Laptops & Electronics > Gaming > Mouses;Gaming Mice

This innovative technology allows you to effectively use the two strands for two independent connections or to double the capacity without digging in a second fiber cable. The converter is completely transparent to the network so the network performs exactly the way it did before &#8212; only now it can support both copper and fiber mediums.<br /><br />This converter provides fiber connectivity to Ethernet segments, allowing for even further networking expansion between extended workgroups. It also provides building-to-building connectivity without the cost and disruption associated with the installation of additional routers.Connecting the converter to fiber segments can further extend distances between networking nodes. This can be achieved by direct connection between the converter and a fiber-based node or networking device. Network managers can install fiber cabling anywhere within a network without changing the arrangement of copper-based Ethernet. The compact size of the converter allows it to be easily deployed in any narrow desktop location or to be used in a wallmount installation. Several converters can be simultaneously installed into a 19"" rack-mountable chassis.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div><img border=""0"" alt="""" src=""https://www.xyz.co.za/Images/510530proee_2.jpg"" width=""630"" height=""255"" /></div></div>";Computers Laptops & Electronics > Networking & Wifi > Adapters & Converters;Networking(Media Converters)

We first saw the P7-C1 Pro, a chassis which left us a little disappointed, but now we have the P7-850W PSU in our labs. While cases can get away with being good looking but not necessarily the best quality, for PSUs it's all a matter of function over form - a shoddy PSU will quickly be exposed by professional testing. That said, Aerocool is definitely looking to tick both boxes with this premium PSU, which adds some RGB flare to what is often one of the most boring components in a PC.</div> <div>&nbsp;<br></div> <div>850W is enough to power some serious hardware. Unless you are planning an overclocked build around Intel X299 or AMD X399 with multiple top-end graphics cards, it should have you covered. The P7-850W Platinum is, as the name suggests, rated at 80 Plus Platinum efficiency, second only to Titanium. Like the majority of PSUs these days, it utilises a single 12V rail design that can deliver practically the full 850W capacity thanks to a 70A rating.&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;<br></div> <div><br></div> <div>As you would expect from PSU at this price, the P7-850W Platinum is fully modular. The total number of peripheral and PCIe connectors and the length of all cables are all suitable for the type of build this PSU is designed for. The cables themselves are flexible, flat, and black, so their presence in builds can be kept to a minimum.&nbsp;</div> <div><img alt=""AeroCool Project 7 RGB Ready 850w 80 Plus Platinum"" src=""https://www.xyz.co.za/Images/4713105957549-001.jpg"" width=""679px"" height=""382px"" title=""AeroCool Project 7 RGB Ready 850w 80 Plus Platinum"" style=""width: 679px; height: 382px;""></div><p><strong>Features of&nbsp;AeroCool Project 7 RGB Ready 850w 80 Plus Platinum:<br><br></strong><strong>850W 80 Plus Platinum Efficiency</strong> -Delivers high energy efficiency for reduced heat and lower energy bills.

It allows you to get incredible performance with enhanced Ray Tracing Cores and Tensor Cores, new streaming multiprocessors, and high-speed GDDR6 memory. VENTUS brings a performance-focused design that maintains the essentials to accomplish any task at hand. A capable triple fan arrangement laid into a rigid industrial design lets this sharp-looking graphics card fit into any build. It features a reinforced backplate with a clean-looking brushed finish that reinforces the length of the card. A custom PCB Design provides greater reliability and beefed up power circuitry for pushing the card to its limits. The award-winning MSI TORX Fan 3.0 keeps the limits of thermal performance turning. Fan blades alternate between traditional blades and dispersion blades that focus and accelerate airflow into the heatsink. The fans completely stop when temperatures are relatively low, eliminating all noise when active cooling is unneeded. The fans will automatically start spinning again when the heat is on during gaming. This GeForce RTX 3060 Ti graphics card with LHR (lite hash rate) delivers 25 MH/s ETH hash rate (est.).</p> <div id=""pastingspan1""><strong>FEATURES:&nbsp;</strong></div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; Boost Clock &#8211; 1695 MHz</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; Memory Speed &#8211; 14 Gbps</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; 8GB GDDR6</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; DisplayPort x 3 (v1.4a), HDMI x 1 (Supports 4K@120Hz as specified in HDMI 2.1)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; Triple Fan Thermal Design</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; TORX Fan 3.0</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; Zero Frozr</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; Thermal Padding</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; Reinforced Backplate</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226; LHR (lite hash rate) Version</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&nbsp;<img src=""https://www.xyz.co.za/Images/MSI%20Nvidia%20GeForce%20RTX%203060-Banner.jpg"" alt="""" width=""512"" height=""365"" /></div>";Computers Laptops & Electronics > Desktop Components > Graphics Cards > Nvidia Graphics Cards;Graphics Cards - NVIDIA

Final Cut Pro Libraries can grow rapidly and out of control. Content creators often turn to USB external drives to store material for Final Cut Pro. When using a Mac, especially portable Macs like the MacBook Pro, external drives are often connected and disconnected, which can lead to wear and tear of the port. External drives are also inconvenient as the files cannot be conveniently shared with coworkers or collaborators and external drives are susceptible to damage in ways a NAS is not. A NAS remains stationary while digitally making your files available to you while an external drive is portable, increasing the risk of drops, spills or other types of damage.</div><div><img src=""https://www.xyz.co.za/Images/FS6706Tmain2.jpg"" alt="""" />&nbsp;</div><div><div id=""pastingspan1""><strong style=""color: #ff0000;"">Features</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>&#8226;Quad-Core 10 nm Intel Celeron N5105 CPU</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;6x M.2 NVMe slots</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Dual Superfast 2.5-Gigabit Ethernet ports</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;4 GB of fast and efficient DDR4-2933 RAM</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;S/PDIF output for amazing sound quality</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Smooth 4K hardware transcoding</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Supports Wake on WAN and Wake on LAN</div><div><strong style=""color: #ff0000;"">&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong style=""color: #ff0000;"">Specifications</strong></div><div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Product Code: FS6706T</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Description: Asustor Flashstor 6 FS6706T 6 Bay All-SSD NAS Storage</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;CPU Model: Intel Celeron N5105</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;CPU Architecture: x64 64-bit</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;CPU Frequency Quad-Core 2.0GHz (burst up 2.90 GHz)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Memory 4GB SO-DIMM DDR4 </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Memory Module Pre-installed 4GB (1x 4GB)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Total Memory Slots 2</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Memory Expandable up to 16GB (2x 8GB) </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Support mixed capacity</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Flash Memory 8GB eMMC</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;M.2 Drive Slots 6 </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Compatible Drive Type </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;M.2 2280 NVMe</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Maximum Drive Bays with Expansion Unit 14</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Expansion: 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2x1; 2 x USB 2.0</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Network: 2x 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet (2.5G/1G/100M)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Multimedia Output 1x HDMI 2.0b, 1x S/PDIF</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;System Fan 1 x 80mm</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Power Supply Unit / Adapter 65W x1</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;0.83 W (Sleep Mode) </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Noise Level 18.7dB</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Operation Temperature 0&#176;C~40&#176;C (32&#176;F~104&#176;F)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Humidity 5% to 95% RH</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Size 48.3 (H) x 308.26 (W) x 193 (D) mm</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Weight 1.35kg / 2.98 lb</div></div></div>";Computers Laptops & Electronics > Networking & Wifi > Network Attached Storage NAS;Network Attached Storage NAS

Final Cut Pro Libraries can grow rapidly and out of control. Content creators often turn to USB external drives to store material for Final Cut Pro. When using a Mac, especially portable Macs like the MacBook Pro, external drives are often connected and disconnected, which can lead to wear and tear of the port. External drives are also inconvenient as the files cannot be conveniently shared with coworkers or collaborators and external drives are susceptible to damage in ways a NAS is not. A NAS remains stationary while digitally making your files available to you while an external drive is portable, increasing the risk of drops, spills or other types of damage.</div><div><img src=""https://www.xyz.co.za/Images/FS6712X.jpg"" alt="""" /></div><div><strong style=""color: #ff0000;"">Features</strong></div><div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Quad-Core 10 nm Intel Celeron N5105 CPU</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;12x M.2 NVMe slots</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Megafast 10-Gigabit Ethernet</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;4 GB of fast and efficient DDR4-2933 RAM</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;S/PDIF output for amazing sound quality</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Smooth 4K hardware transcoding</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Supports Wake on LAN</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong style=""color: #ff0000;"">Specifications</strong></div><div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Product code: FS6712X</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Description: Asustor Flashstor 12 Pro FS6712X 12 Bay All-SSD NAS Storage</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;CPU Model: Intel Celeron N5105</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;CPU Architecture: x64 64-bit</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;CPU Frequency Quad-Core 2.0GHz (burst up 2.90 GHz)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Memory 4GB SO-DIMM DDR4 </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Memory Module Pre-installed 4GB (1x 4GB)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Total Memory Slots 2</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Memory Expandable up to 16GB (2x 8GB) </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Support mixed capacity</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Flash Memory 8GB eMMC</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;M.2 Drive Slots 12 </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Compatible Drive Type </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;M.2 2280 NVMe</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Maximum Drive Bays with Expansion Unit 20</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;External Ports</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Expansion: 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2x1; 2 x USB 2.0</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Network 1 x 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10G/5G/2.5G/1G/100M/10M)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Multimedia Output 1x HDMI 2.0b, 1x S/PDIF</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;System Fan: 1 x 80mm</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Power Supply Unit / Adapter 90W x1</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Input Power Voltage 100V to 240V AC</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Certification FCC, CE, VCCI, BSMI, C-TICK, KCC, BIS, CCC, UKCA</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Power Consumption: 26 W </div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Noise Level: 18.7dB</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Operation Temperature: 0&#176;C~40&#176;C (32&#176;F~104&#176;F)</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Humidity: 5% to 95% RH</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Size and Weight</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Size 48.3 (H) x 308.26 (W) x 193 (D) mm</div><div id=""pastingspan1"">&#8226;Weight 1.37 kg / 3 lb</div></div></div>";Computers Laptops & Electronics > Networking & Wifi > Network Attached Storage NAS;Network Attached Storage NAS
